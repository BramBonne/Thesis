\chapter{Introduction}

Over the last few years, the web has shifted from being a collection of pages containing static information to a dynamic and fully interactive platform. Where the internet was once used only as an information repository, today it powers complex web applications. These web applications are developed both to replace programs that were once running locally on a user's computer, and to provide whole new functionality that is possible only on the web. For this, web protocols to be used and extended in ways they were never imagined to be.

More than in the past, these web applications deal with sensitive personal information. Thanks to the emergence of web-based mail applications akin to Google's GMail and Microsoft's Hotmail, and social networks like Facebook and Netlog, a great deal of user information is stored on the servers of web applications. Moreover, shops have moved to the online world, and payments can be made online by using online banking or credit cards. Because many web applications handle such sensitive information, security is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, security in web applications is often lacking \cite{Brown2010}.

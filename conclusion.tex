\chapter{Conclusion}%TODO

In this thesis, we looked at security in web applications that make use of sessions to manage user authentication.

We started by showing the different methods of session handling that exist on the web today. We discussed how session identifiers can be accessed, and which properties a good session identifier should possess.

Next, we discussed the ways in which session management mechanisms can be exploited by an attacker to make him able to act on a web server as if he was another user. As we saw, these attacks are very applicable in the present dynamic web, which makes great use of user management and user generated content. We showed that, while the attacks themselves are not very complicated, many attack vectors are available. This allows an attacker to create complex attack scenarios which are difficult to prevent.

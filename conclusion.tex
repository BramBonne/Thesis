\chapter{Conclusion}%TODO

In this thesis, we have shown the different methods of session handling that exist on the web today. We discussed how session identifiers can be accessed, and which properties a good session identifier should posess.

Next, we discussed the ways in which session management mechanisms can be exploited by an attacker to make him able to act on a web server as if he was another user. We showed that these attacks are often very complex, and that many different attack vectors are available.
